\subsection{References}
I will use the C\# language standard~\cite{ecma334} and the Common Language Infrastructure(CIL) standard~\cite{ecma335}.
I will also make use of the official .NET compiler documentation on the Microsoft Developer Network~\cite{msdn} as well as the official mono documentation~\cite{mono}.
